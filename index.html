            <p class="intro">Welcome to the tarot card generator. Do you have something on your mind? To use this generator, please be relaxed and have clear intentions. Ask yourself anything about your past, your future, your worries - anything about your life. Avoid asking yes/no questions. Tarot cards do not tell the future.</p>
            <p class="intro">This tarot card deck is intended to provide a small message about life, love, or career. One arcana card will be presented to you with spiritual insight. Try to be accepting of the message without abusing the "draw card" button. Part of the fun in tarot cards is trying to interpret what the card is trying to convey.</p>
            <p class="intro">Are you ready to begin? Ask yourself one question and then click "draw card".</p>
