# Personal Project: Tarot Card Reader
The purpose of this project was to practice JavaScript and to hone in my HTML & CSS skills. The intent of this project was to create a fun & simple random card generator for users who are interested in tarot readings. In these trying times, many find tarot readings as a way to help mental health, and believe that it is a way to gain spiritual insight & guidance in our current situations.
